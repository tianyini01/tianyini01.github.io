Modern Burmese sandhi-voicing is a challenging phonology-morphology interface phenomenon. In general, the degree of the juncture linking two syllables determines if the sandhi-voicing is triggered or not. It is widely accepted that the absence of the voicing gives the evidence of open juncture, while close juncture contributes to the voicing (Soe, 1999; Nishi, 1998). However, some data from Vittrant (2012) and Jenny and Hnin Tun (2016) disprove this proposal. It has been discussed that the Emergent Grammar (EG) framework (Archangeli & Pulleyblank, 2022) surpasses generative rule ordering (Chomsky & Halle, 1968) and Optimality Theory (Smolensky & Prince, 1993) in analyzing similar phenomena. Specifically, the EG framework gives a relatively flexible link between the responsibilities of a languagesâ€™s phonological and morphological system via DOMAIN (McCullough, 2020). By saying that, within the framework of EG, the phonology and the morphology of a language is allowed to interact. This paper presents an analysis of Modern Burmese sandhi-voicing from the perspective of EG. On the way to my goal, a detailed process of how Modern Burmese learners acquire the sandhi-voicing pattern is also presented. This paper also uncovers the difference in Modern Burmese acquisition with respect to the words with different lengths and morphology. Last but not least, with the analysis of EG, I argue that the absence of the voicing does not necessarily mean an open juncture between morphemes or syllables within a word.
